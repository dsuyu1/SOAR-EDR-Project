# 5.0: Creating the Playbook
## Objective
The objective of this section is to create our playbook. If you can remember in section 1.0, I made a diagram of the playbook workflow we are aiming for. We want the playbook to send a Slack message and email containing information about the detection. We also want to generate a user prompt that asks us if we want to isolate the machine. If yes, then the machine will be isolated, and if no, then the prompt will ask us to investigate further without isolating the machine. 

Let's get started! ðŸ˜¸

## Steps
To begin, let's refer back to the diagram we created in section 1.0. So far, we have completed the first two steps of the playbook:
- Send events from the infected machine to LimaCharlie
- Send detections (alerts) from LimaCharlie to Tines
