# 2.0: Installing LimaCharlie
## Objective
The objective in this section is to get our Windows virtual machine up and running, configure and install LimaCharlie, and confirm that our endpoint is generating events and that LimaCharlie is ingesting that telemetry! I'm excited, and I hope you are too! ðŸ™‚

## Steps
I will be using Vultr to start my virtual machine. Vultr is a cloud solution, but we don't need to use Vultr for this project to work. We could use any computer sitting around that is connected to the internet, or we could use VirtualBox to spin up a virtual machine of our own. However, the tutorial I was following gave me a free $100 credit, and I said why not! It gives me another oppurtunity to use another tool. The $100 credit will last me long enough to see this project to completion. If the oppurtunity presents itself, however, I could definitely start the project again from a Linux, Windows, or Mac machine - it's really that simple!

Installing the machine was easy - it's a point-and-click adventure. I even added a firewall, but that isn't really relevant so I won't include a picture. Just so you know, it was as easy as clicking "Add Firewall" and removing and adding rules, then attaching that to my virtual machine.

Once deployed, we can start setting up LimaCharlie. After logging in, I was presented with a dashboard that looks like this:

As you can see, I am writing this after installing LimaCharlie in the Windows 10 virtual machine. It is already connected to LimaCharlie as a "Sensor."

LimaCharlie is really awesome! We have lots of litte tabs we can go into and snoop around our agent. For example, under the "Console" tab, we can remotely run commands in the command line.

Later on, we'll be playing with the `Extensions` and `Automation` settings. Outputs lets us integrate LimaCharlie data into other cloud tools. Spoiler alert: we're going to be using Tines!

To actually install LimaCharlie onto our virtual machine, we need to download and run `https://downloads.limacharlie.io/sensor/windows/64` on our virtual machine along with our installation key.
