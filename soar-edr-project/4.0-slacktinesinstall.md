# 4.0: Installing Slack and Tines
## Objective
In this section, I'll be installing Slack and Tines. I'll ingest my first detection into Tines, and in the next section, I'll be making the playbook.

## Steps
To begin, I set up Slack. Creating an account is just like any other platform - I signed up with Google. I configured my Workspace to be called dsuyu-SOAR-EDR, and that's it! I made a new channel called `alerts`; when we recieve a detection from LimaCharlie to Tines, those alerts will appear there.

Now that we've configured Slack, I made an account with Tines. Once in, we can see lots of options on the left to create our playbook, or "story," as it's called in Tines. We can select templates from the bottom left for tools such as VirusTotal. We could even start with a playbook "story" template.

We'll be using a Webhook to connect LimaCharlie and Tines.
