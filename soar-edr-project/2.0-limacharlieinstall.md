# 2.0: Installing LimaCharlie
## Objective
This section aims to get our Windows virtual machine up and running, configure and install LimaCharlie, and confirm that our endpoint is generating events and that LimaCharlie is ingesting that telemetry! I'm excited, and I hope you are too! ðŸ™‚

## Steps
I will be using Vultr to start my virtual machine. Vultr is a cloud solution, but we don't need to use Vultr for this project to work. We could use any computer sitting around that is connected to the internet, or we could use VirtualBox to spin up a virtual machine of our own. However, the tutorial I followed gave me a free $100 credit, and I said why not! It gives me another opportunity to use another tool. The $100 credit will last me long enough to see this project completed. If the opportunity presents itself, however, I could start the project again from a Linux, Windows, or Mac machine - it's really that simple!

<br><br>

Installing the machine was easy - it's a point-and-click adventure. I even added a firewall, but that isn't relevant so I won't include a picture. Just so you know, it was as easy as clicking "Add Firewall" and removing and adding rules, then attaching that to my virtual machine.

Once deployed, we can start setting up LimaCharlie. After logging in, I was presented with a dashboard that looked like this:

As you can see, I am writing this after installing LimaCharlie in the Windows 10 virtual machine. It is already connected to LimaCharlie as a "Sensor."

LimaCharlie is awesome! We have lots of little tabs we can go into and snoop around our agent. For example, under the "Console" tab, we can remotely run commands in the command line.

Later on, we'll be playing with the `Extensions` and `Automation` settings. Outputs let us integrate LimaCharlie data into other cloud tools. Spoiler alert: we're going to be using Tines!

To install LimaCharlie onto our virtual machine, we need to download and run `https://downloads.limacharlie.io/sensor/windows/64` on our virtual machine along with our installation key. The command to install the program would look something like this: `lc_sensor.msi InstallationKey="YOUR_INSTALLATION_KEY"`

## Summary
And that concludes this section! We spun up our virtual machine and installed LimaCharlie onto it. I also looked around LimaCharlie and all its capabilities. Within our Sensor, that is, under the tab designated for our virtual machine, we have access to all these options:

<i>Ref 5: Looking under Sensors and clicking our the virtual machine's host name we can see a lot of options!</i>

I cut out all the details just in case, but LimaCharlie tells us what platform we're running (Windows x86 64 bit), our hostname, our internal and external IP addresses, our MAC address, and so on. 

One of my favorite features of LimaCharlie is that we can go into the host's file system. We can navigate through their files and do some investigating. We can also view what processes and services are running, as well as a timeline and if any new users were created.
