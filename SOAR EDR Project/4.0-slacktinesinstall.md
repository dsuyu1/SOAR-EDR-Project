# 4.0: Installing Slack and Tines
## Objective
In this section, I'll install Slack and Tines, ingest my first detection into Tines, and create the playbook in the next section.

## Steps
To begin with, I set up Slack. Creating an account is just like any other platform; I signed up with Google. I configured my Workspace to be called dsuyu-SOAR-EDR, and that's it! I made a new channel called `alerts`; when we receive a detection from LimaCharlie to Tines, those alerts will appear there.

<br><br>


Now that we've configured Slack, I made an account with Tines. Once in, we can see lots of options on the left to create our playbook, or "story," as it's called in Tines. We can select templates from the bottom left for tools such as VirusTotal. We could even start with a playbook "story" template.

We'll be using a Webhook to connect LimaCharlie and Tines.

<br><br>

In LimaCharlie, we have to go to the `Outputs` tab to connect via a webhook. Selecting `Add Output`, we can choose Tines as our output and use the webhook link we received from Tines under `Destination Host`.

LimaCharlie will now send detections through the output to Tines. If we generate an event in our virtual machine by running LaZagne again, we'll be able to see the detection in Tines!

## Summary
In this section, I created accounts for Slack and Tines. Using the webhook feature in Tines, I was able to ingest detections from LimaCharlie. In the next section, we'll be creating the playbook. ðŸ˜º
