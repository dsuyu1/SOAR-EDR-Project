# 5.0: Writing Our Story
## Objective
The objective of this section is to create our playbook. If you can remember in section 1.0, I made a diagram of the playbook workflow we are aiming for. We want the playbook to send a Slack message and email containing information about the detection. We also want to generate a user prompt that asks us if we want to isolate the machine. If yes, then the machine will be isolated, and if no, then the prompt will ask us to investigate further without isolating the machine. 

Let's get started! ðŸ˜¸

## Steps
To begin, let's refer back to the diagram we created in section 1.0. So far, we have completed the first two steps of the playbook:
- Send events from the infected machine to LimaCharlie
- Send detections (alerts) from LimaCharlie to Tines

<p align="center"><i>Ref 1: We have completed the first two steps in the playbook.</i></p>
<br><br>

Next, we want Tines to send a message over to Slack. Let's do that! First, we have to add Tines to Slack.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7uaObsD.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 2: Searching for Tines under Apps in Slack.</i></p>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Wuxfrck.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 3: We are led to this page after clicking on Add.</i></p>
<br><br>

To do this, we can follow Tine's instructions. We need to log in to Tines, navigate to our "Team," add a `New Credential`, and select Slack. After selecting Slack, we'll be asked to connect our Slack workspace. After that, we will have a new Slack credential that we can use. Essentially, this establishes the link between Tines and Slack.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PaqihTU.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 4: My Slack credential within Tines.</i></p>
<br><br>

Once I've connected Tines and Slack, I can test the connection by sending a message from Tines to Slack. Heading back to the story, we can use the Slack template in the bottom left corner. On the right, we can look for certain actions. In our case, we want to send a message. We can do that by selecting the action "Send a message." 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3JyVSWN.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 5: By selecting "Templates," we can find the Slack template. From here, we can use the template to select the action "Send a message."</i></p>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ojfxxrf.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 6: Our Slack widget is set to send a message.</i></p>
<br><br>

The Slack widget takes many parameters, like, for example, the channel ID it will broadcast to (send the message to) and the actual message. For right now, we'll set the message to "Hello, World!" Classic. ðŸ˜¼ As a side note, to get the specific channel ID we want to send our message to, we can do that in Slack. By right-clicking the specific channel and navigating a little bit, we can find the channel ID. By clicking "Test," we can test to see if our Slack widget is working as expected. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qaGASUI.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 7: We can click "Test" to see if the Slack widget is working as expected.</i></p>
<br><br>

After clicking test, our message is sent to the #alerts channel!

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Mk24tR9.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 8: Our message is sent!</i></p>
<br><br>

Now that we've tested the workflow and it's working as intended, we can start adding the details that we want to the message. Remember, we wanted the message to contain information such as the host IP, the hostname, username, file path, sensor ID, etc. Before we do that, however, let's get started on sending that email we wanted. Not only do we want a Slack message, but we want an email as well.

We can use the email template to create the email action. I'll set it to send to my email, and for the message, we can leave it as the default for the sake of testing.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gGXa4Zq.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 9: Sending an email using the email template.</i></p>
<br><br>

So far, we have successfully set up the Slack message and the email. Looking at our playbook, we can see that next is creating the user prompt. To create the user prompt, we can use what Tines calls a "Page." A Page is nothing more than a webpage. We'll be using the Page to ask the user if they want to isolate the machine. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mKHCkfL.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 10: Setting up the user prompt as a Page in Tines.</i></p>
<br><br>

We'll edit the Page so that it takes a boolean Yes/No in regards to isolating the machine. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8L8HAD3.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 11: Editing our Page.</i></p>
<br><br>
                    
If you remember, we wanted to include the detection details in the user prompt, email, and Slack message. Let's try integrating those details into our Page. To do that, we'll have to do a little research first. If we look into the body of the events of our "Retrieve Detections" webhook, we can see lots of interesting details. These fields can be copied and pasted so that they dynamically update depending on which event they correspond to. For example, if we copy the "cat" field, we'll get this: `<<retrieve_detections.body.cat>>`. Effectively, this retrieves the detection details from the body of the event, specifically for the "cat" field. We can use these fields within the bodies of our Slack messages, emails, and user prompts. 

We're essentially pulling the data from our webhook and using it within the bodies of our messages. ðŸ˜„

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/klJjAOz.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 12: We're pulling data from our "Retrieve Detections" webhook and using it within the body of our Slack message.</i></p>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/R7yUz5Q.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 13: Tines sends a message within our #alerts Slack channel with all the details we wanted!</i></p>
<br><br>

Now that we've formatted our Slack message to look awesome, we'll format our email as well. We edit the actual HTML of the email rather than just copying and pasting so it looks a little nicer. After, we can test it the same way we have with the other actions (clicking the Test button).

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S4RKtVW.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 14: Formatting our email to look nice. </i></p>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4nf6xFU.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 15: After sending a test, the email is looking good! Afterward, I formatted the link a little better so that it's a hyperlink rather than a plain old link.</i></p>
<br><br>

We'll do the same for our Page. I copied and pasted the body of our previous messages into the body of our Page. By visiting the page, we can test to see if it's working as expected.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EnFavXK.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 16: The Page is working as expected.</i></p>
<br><br>

Next, referring back to our playbook, it's time to implement the Yes/No decision logic. In Tines, we can use what they call "triggers."

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/z1JTdOf.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 17: Setting up a trigger to use the user's answer from the user prompt for decision-making. In this case, we're making the No path, where a boolean "False" from the user prompt will lead to this path.</i></p>
<br><br>

If No, then we want Tines to send a Slack message that notifies us that the "Computer was not isolated, please investigate." 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6GpuIOo.png">
<i>Ref 18: In the Message section of our action, we want the Slack message to contain the computer's name as well as something that tells us that the computer was not isolated.</i>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JGhnq6p.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 19: We get an alert in the #alerts channel that the computer was not isolated.</i></p>
<br><br>

Lastly, we need to create the logic in case the user says Yes. If Yes, then we want LimaCharlie to isolate the sensor and for Slack to send us a message confirming the isolation status of the sensor. This involves creating a new credential, similar to Slack, for LimaCharlie. Because we want to send a message to LimaCharlie, we need to use their API. Thankfully, LimaCharlie makes this easy.

Going to LimaCharlie's [documentation](https://docs.limacharlie.io/v1/docs/platform-management-api-keys), they recommend using Organization API keys whenever possible. Therefore, in order to add the LimaCharlie credential in Tines, we're going to use our Organization API key.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/reESucI.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 20: Creating a new trigger for Yes.</i></p>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0hszyyl.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 21: Getting our Organization API key.</i></p>
<br><br>

Before setting up the API in Tines, let's make a new HTTP request. Using the templates Tines conveniently provides to us, we can take the LimaCharlie template and search for "Isolate Sensor," since that is what we want to do. This request uses the computer's SID to identify it (naturally). If you remember, the SID can be found under `routing` in the body of our event. Copying the SID field, we get this: `<<retrieve_detections.body.routing.sid>>`. This is what we want to paste into our URL.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Oni4uMS.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 22: Using the SID field so that the API can locate the right sensor to isolate.</i></p>
<br><br>

At this point, we need to add that LimaCharlie credential I mentioned earlier. Remember that organization API key? We're going to use that to make our credential.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BPnD9oR.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 23: Making our LimaCharlie credential. For me, it shows up since I'm adding these references after the fact, but to make the credential, we'd select "Text" (since there is no LimaCharlie credential template) and paste our Organization API Key under "Value." Importantly, where it says "Domains," we want to put *limacharlie.io ensuring the credential can only be used towards LimaCharlie and its subdomains.</i></p>
<br><br>

After creating our LimaCharlie credential, we can now connect our widgets to the LimaCharlie API, similar to how we did with Slack. After running the workflow now, the computer will be isolated if we select Yes in the user prompt. 

Now, all that's left is to get the isolation status message in Slack. Since there is no actual "isolation status" field in our event, we have to use a new widget to give us an isolation status. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VLo9qmc.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 24: Using a new HTTP request LimaCharlie widget to get the isolation status of our sensor (we use the same sensor ID field mentioned previously).</i></p>
<br><br>

Using this new widget, we can integrate the isolation status into a Slack message. Similar to how we included the details of the event in our email and user prompt, we'll use the `get_isolation_status.body.is_isolated` status in our Slack message. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MaVGwZc.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 25: Creating a new Slack action to send a message to our #alerts channel that the computer has been isolated.</i></p>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M8Zityf.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 26: The action successfully sent a message stating that the computer was isolated.</i></p>
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/VL5ilc7.png"></p>
<p align="center"><i>Ref 27: Navigating to LimaCharlie, we can see that the sensor was successfully isolated!</i></p>
<br><br>

Perfect! We're done! Now, all that's left is to test the story out.

## Summary
Overall, this project was a lot of fun. I got to work with two very fun tools, LimaCharlie and Tines. Both were very easy to work with, and I can see how they would be helpful in the real world. I'm really glad I was able to complete this project ðŸ˜„

The learning doesn't end here, however. There are a few things I'd like to change with the playbook. For example, what if we try isolating the sensor when it's already isolated? Can we implement some more features, such as creating a button that gives us event logs for a specific event? I'm sure the sky is the limit when it comes to Tines. I'll continue to update this repository as I play with the playbook more.

Thank you for reading until the end! I hope you had some fun following along. I will see you all in the next project! ðŸš€
