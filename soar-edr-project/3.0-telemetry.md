# 3.0: Generating Telemetry
## Objective
My objective in this section is to start generating telemetry related to [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne). I will also create a detection and response rule so that I can send it over to Tines for automation.

## Steps
### Generating LaZagne telemetry
To start, let's download LaZagne on my virtual machine. We have to disable some features of Windows Security, specifically, Real-Time Protection. We'll be running it within Powershell, like this:

<i>Ref 1: Running LaZagne.</i>
<br><br>

If we go back to LimaCharlie and check the `Timeline`, we can see that running LaZagne generated some events!

<i>Ref 2: LaZagne generated some telemetry, and we can see this under the NEW_DOCUMENT event.</i>
<br><br>

<i>Ref 3: Under the NEW_PROCESS event, we can see more details.</i>
<br><br>

Under the NEW_PROCESS event, we get lots more details, such as:
- The command line
- The file path
- The parent process ID and process ID
- Hash
- Username
- and more!

### Making a new rule
[According to LimaCharlie](https://docs.limacharlie.io/docs/detection-and-response):
Detection & Response rules automate actions based on the real-time events streaming into LimaCharlie. Each rule has two YAML descriptors: one that describes what to detect, and another that describes how to respond.

Let's make a new D&R (detection and response) rule! Navigating under `Automation` and selecting `New Rule`, we are sent to a page that looks like this:

<i>Ref 4: Making a new rule.</i>
<br><br>

Rather than writing a rule from scratch, we can search for a rule that already exists that's similar to what we want. Here is what the final rule looks like:

<i>Ref 5: New rule that detects LaZagne!</i>
<br><br>

Don't worry, I am going to break down what each component of this rule means! ðŸ˜¸

```yaml
events:
  - NEW_PROCESS
  - EXISTING_PROCESS
```
The rule applies to two events: `NEW_PROCESS` and `EXISTING_PROCESS`. In other words, the event type must be either `NEW_PROCESS` or `EXISTING_PROCESS`.

```yaml
op: and
```
`op: and` is an example of a **detection logic operator**. You can read more about them [here](https://docs.limacharlie.io/docs/detection-logic-operators). This line states that the rule applies **only** if the event type is either of the two mentioned above, **and** the following conditions:

```yaml
rules:
  - op: is windows
```
The host **must** be a Windows machine.
