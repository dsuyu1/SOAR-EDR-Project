# 3.0: Generating Telemetry
## Objective
My objective in this section is to start generating telemetry related to [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne). I will also create a detection and response rule so that I can send it over to Tines for automation.

## Steps
To start, let's download LaZagne on my virtual machine. We have to disable some features of Windows Security, specifically, Real-Time Protection. We'll be running it within Powershell, like this:

If we go back to LimaCharlie and check the `Timeline`, we can see that running LaZagne generated some events!
