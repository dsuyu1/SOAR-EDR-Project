## Objective
This workflow diagram outlines our playbook. The playbook objective is to:
- Send a Slack message and an email containing important details about the detection
- Tines will prompt the user if they want to isolate the machine (Yes/No)
- If Yes, LimaCharlie will automatically isolate the machine.

### From start to finish:
 - We'll create detection with LimaCharlie; it will detect a hack tool
 - We'll push this alert to Tines, which will forward that alert to Slack and our email

The Slack message and email will contain:
- Time
- Computer Name
- Source IP
- Process
- Command line
- File path
- Sensor ID
- Link to the detection

Tines will then prompt the user to isolate the machine (Yes/No).
- if yes: LimaCharlie will automatically isolate the machine and send a message to Slack.
- if no: LimaCharlie will not isolate the machine.
